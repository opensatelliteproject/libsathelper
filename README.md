libSatHelper
==================

Helper library for decoding Satellite Signals.

Features
=========

*   Viterbi27 Decode / Encode (wrapper from [libcorrect](https://github.com/quiet/libcorrect))
*   CCSDS ReedSolomon Decode (wrapper from [libcorrect](https://github.com/quiet/libcorrect))
*   ReedSolomon [De]Interleaver
*   Correlator for Sync Word
*   Packet Phase Ambiguity Fixer (For 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees and IQ Inversion)
*   Working on Windows

How to build (Linux / MacOSX)
=====================

If you don't want to worry about installing `libcorrect` and running all steps manually, just make sure you have your OS development tools (gcc / clang) and run:

```bash
make libcorrect
sudo make libcorrect-install
make
sudo make install
```

This should install both libSatHelper and libcorrect.

How to build (Windows)
======================

TODO: Now we use [libcorrect](https://github.com/quiet/libcorrect) instead libfec.

OLD:

```
For windows it should be compiled using Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (it should work with mingw, but not tested). First you need to compile the modified [libfec](https://github.com/racerxdl/libfec) that can compile in mingw32 and generate the msvc libraries (everything described on libfec's readme). After that create a folder named `winfec` and copy the `fec.h`, `libfec.lib`, `libfec.exp`. Then you shoud be able to compile `libSatHelper.dll` in Visual Studio. The Solution was made in Visual Studio 2015
```


GO Wrappers
=================

Now libSatHelper has golang wrappers. It's currently under test with [SatHelperApp](https://github.com/opensatelliteproject/SatHelperApp/) but so far it seens to be working pretty well. By default you can use it as a normal Go Library by running

```bash
go get github.com/opensatelliteproject/libsathelper
```

Just make sure you have `libSatHelper` installed in your OS (your Go app will be linked to it).

One thing to notice for devs, I included the SWIG generated `SatHelper_wrap.cxx` and `SatHelper.go`, these are automatically generated by swig, you can update them (in case you want to change) by running:

```bash
make updatego
```
